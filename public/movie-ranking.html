<h1>My Top TV Shows According to Ahmed</h1>
<h2>My top 3 Movies of all time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>1. Peaky Blinders</h3>
<p>Hell, where do i even start, it is perfect, the plot is great, the story is top notch, the actors are insane. Everything about it is perfect. The ending however was not so great but it was good enough for me to rank it as the best.</p>
<h3>2. Breaking Bad</h3>
<p>It was the best overall show. From start to finish. Perfecto.</p>
<h3>3. The Originals</h3>
<p>Acting was good, story line too.</p>
